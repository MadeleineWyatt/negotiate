    <p><strong>1.</strong> Should adverts and hiring conversations include the pay range?</p>
    <p>Yes or No</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Make ranges visible in adverts and interviews. Hidden ranges advantage people with insider knowledge and reproduce gaps.</p>

    <p><strong>2.</strong> Should you ask for a candidate’s previous salary?</p>
    <p>Yes or No</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p><strong>No.</strong> Salary history questions carry past inequities into a new role. Set offers from the band, the role value and clear criteria.</p>

    <p><strong>3.</strong> Should you encourage candidates to negotiate?</p>
    <p>Yes or No</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>Yes, but inside a transparent system.</strong> Invite all candidates to discuss predefined items and publish the pay range.
        Explain clearly what is and is not negotiable, and offer a standard package for all new starters.
        Research shows that negotiations under ambiguity expose women to greater social penalties and often lead to inequitable outcomes.
        Removing hidden rules and reducing ambiguity helps prevent gaps at the point of hire (Bowles, Thomason &amp; Bear 2019).

  <!-- Q4 -->
  <div style="padding:8px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee">
    <p><strong>4.</strong> Two candidates of equal merit. One negotiates, one does not. Do you only raise the pay for the one who asked?</p>
    <p>Yes or No</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p><strong>No.</strong> Advocate for equity. Align offers so equal merit receives equal pay. Do not let silence cost someone money.</p>

  <!-- Q5 -->
  <div style="padding:8px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee">
    <p><strong>5.</strong> Bands are fixed. Should you offer non-salary benefit bundles based on how hard a candidate negotiates?</p>
    <p>Yes or No</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p><strong>No.</strong> Non-salary benefits can be negotiated, but only within clearly defined limits. They should follow consistent rules and ranges and must not be adjusted ad hoc based on who pushes hardest. Benefits should not be used to work around fixed salary bands or to justify uneven treatment across hires.
